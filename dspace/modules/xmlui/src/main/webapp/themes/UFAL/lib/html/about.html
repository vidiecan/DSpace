		<br/>
		<p>
			The ultimate objective of CLARIN ERIC is to advance research in humanities and social sciences by giving researchers unified single sign-on access to a platform which integrates language-based resources and advanced tools at a European level. This shall be implemented by the construction and operation of a shared distributed infrastructure that aims at making language resources, technology and expertise available to the humanities and social sciences (henceforth abbreviated HSS) research communities at large.

		<p>It is like a library for linguistic data and tools.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Search for data and tools and easily download them.</li>
			<li>Deposit the data and be sure it is safely stored, everyone
				can find it, use it, and correctly cite it (giving you credit)</li>

		<h3 id="about-ufal">About UFAL</h3>
		<p>
		The Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (ÃšFAL) at the Computer Science School, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic was established in 1990 as a continuation of the research and teaching activities carried out by the former Laboratory of Algebraic Linguistics since the early 60s at the Faculty of Philosophy and later at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague, is a primarily research department working on many topics in the area of Computational Linguistics, and on many research projects both nationally and internationally. However, the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics is also a regular department in the sense that it carries a comprehensive teaching program both for the Master's degree (Mgr., or MSc.) as well as for a doctorate (Ph.D.) in Computational Linguistics. Both programs are taught in Czech and English. The Institute is also a member of the double-degree "Master's LCT programme" of the EU. Students also can take advantage of the Erasmus program for typically semester-long stays at partner Universities abroad.

		<h3 id="about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</h3>
		<p>At the moment, UFAL distinguishes three types of contracts.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For every deposit, we enter into a standard contract with the submitter, the so-called <a id="distribution-link" href="contract">"Deposition License Agreement"</a>, in which we describe our rights and duties and the submitter acknowledges that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository centre) right to distribute the data on their behalf.</li>
			<li>Everyone who downloads data is bound by the licence assigned to the item - in order to download protected data, one has to be authenticated and needs to electronically sign the licence. A list of available licenses in our repository can be found <a href="licenses" id="available-licenses">here.</a></li>
			<li>For submitters, there is a possibility for setting custom licences to items during the submission workflow.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<div>
		<h3 id="about-ipr">Intelectual Property Rights</h3>
		<p>
As mentioned in the section <a href="#about-contracts">License Agreement and Contracts</a>, we require the depositor of data or tools to sign a Deposition License Agreement, which specifies that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository centre) right to distribute the data on their behalf. This means that depositors are solely responsible for taking care of IPR issues before publishing data or tools by submitting them to us.
<br/>
Should anyone have a suspicion that any of the datasets or tools in our repository violate Intelectual Property Rights, they should contact us immediately at our help desk.
