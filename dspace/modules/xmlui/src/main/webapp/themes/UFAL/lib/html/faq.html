	<h3 id="what-is-the-repository">What is the repository?</h3>
	<p>It is like a library for linguistic data and tools.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Search for data and tools and easily download them.</li>
		<li>Deposit the data and be sure it is safely stored, everyone
			can find it, use it, and correctly cite it (giving you credit)</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-submissions-do-you-accept">What submissions do we
		accept?</h3>
	<p>We accept any linguistic and/or NLP data and tools: corpora,
		treebanks, lexica, but also trained language models, parsers, taggers,
		MT systems, linguistic web services, etc. We do not strictly require
		you to upload the data itself, although it is always better to do it.
		Still, you can make a metadata-only record, if required. We also
		support online license-signing for immediate availability of
		restricted resources.</p>
	<p>
		When uploading language resources, please try to use one of the recommended formats
		mentioned in <a href='http://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/Standards%20for%20LRT-v6.pdf'>LRT Standards</a>.

	<h3
		id="do-i-need-to-create-an-account-to-download-andor-make-a-submission">Do
		I need to create an account to download and/or make a submission?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You can download <strong>data and tools with a
				license that allows free sharing</strong> without any obstacles. Just read
			the license and download. This applies to all data with <a
			href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> and
			tools with <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses" target="_blank">open source</a>
			licenses.
		</li>
		<li>To download data and tools that require you to sign a
			license, you need to log in. To make a submission, you also need to
			log in. However, if you are from academic world, you probably don't
			need any new account.</li>
		<li><strong>Just click &quot;Login&quot; and search for
				your academic institution.</strong> To sign in, you can use any account with
			a Identity Provider that is a member of EduGAIN federation.</li>
		<li>If you don't have an academic account that works with us, let
			us know. We will make you a local account.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="why-should-i-submit-my-data-into-your-repository">Why
		should I submit my data into your repository?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>It is free and safe.</li>
		<li>We respect your license. We encourage Free Data and believe
			it benefits not only users, but also the data providers. However we
			accept also more closed data and we can make users sign a license
			before downloading your data, if that is what you need.</li>
		<li>The data is visible, giving you maximal credit for your work.
			(google, VLO, DataCite, arXive)</li>
		<li>The data is easy to cite. We provide <em>ready-to-use</em>
			one-click citations in Bibtex, RIS, and other popular reference
			formats. All the citations include permanent links created from persistent identifiers (we use handles for PIDs). 
            These PIDs are future-proof.
		</li>
		<li>For some data, like text corpora or treebanks, we can provide
			additional services, like full-text or even tree-query search.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="why-should-i-submit-my-tools">Why should I submit my
		tools?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>See &quot;Why should I submit my data into your
			repository?&quot;. Everything applies to software tools too.</li>
		<li>You can just link your version control system (svn, git),
			if it is publicly accessible. You can also link your project
			page, or demo site.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-is-the-handle-good-for">What is the PID (handle) good for?</h3>
	<p>It is a special permanent URL. It provides a permanent link that
		will resolve correctly even if in some distant future the data is
		moved. Thus it should be used as URL in citations.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-is-deposit-procedure">What is the actual depositing/archiving procedure?</h3>
	<p>During the submission of digital language resources to the repository, the data undergo a curation 
    process in order to ensure quality and consistency. We assist you in meeting necessary requirements 
    for sustainable resource archiving. Data have to be provided with metadata in standard formats 
    accepted/adopted in the respective communities, persistent identifiers (PIDs) have to be assigned, IPR 
    issues have to be resolved and clear statements with regard to licensing and possible use of the 
    resources are to be made.

    The depositor is also required to electronically sign a deposition agreement acknowledging the 
    (s)he is the holder of rights to the data and that (s)he has the right to grant the 
    rights contained in this licence.

    Once the data is indeed deposited in the repository it is assigned a PID for stable reference. </p>
	</div>

    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-update">What if I want/need to update the archived data?</h3>
	<p>Every change to the resources and metadata should be stored as a new version with a new PID.
    However if the changes are minimal (e.g., typos or clear mistakes) then contact our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> with
    the submission PID and the changes which should be made. It is up to the reviewer to decide whether these changes
    should result in a new version or not.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-delete">What if I want to withdraw the resources in the future? Can I delete the data?</h3>
    <p>Yes, in this case contact our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> with the submission PID and the reason. 
    However, we need to keep a reference that the data was in our repository (because a persistent identifier was issued), so the administrative metadata will be retained indicating that the data itself were removed.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-embargo">I don't want / cannot make the data publicly available or make 
    them available after a specific date. Would you still archive them for me?</h3>
    <p>In accordance with the advocacy of the research infrastructures and the general development 
    with respect to Open Access, we strongly encourage the data producers to be as open as possible.
    
    However, in other circumstances we will archive your data even if they will not be publicly available. Please, contact 
    our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> prior to completing the submission.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-cite">How to cite a submissions?</h3>
	<p>See our <a href="./about">policies</a>.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="how-safe-is-my-data-if-i-store-it-with-you">How safe is my
		data, if I store it with you?</h3>
	<p>Quite safe, probably much more than in your computer. Our
		storage plan:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>All the data in the repository have a on-site backup copy.</li>
		<li>There is another off-site copy, so even complete destruction
			of our building does not destroy your data.</li>
		<li>We check all the copies regularly and should any of them
			become corrupted we delete it and make a new one.</li>
		<li>We keep at least three copies, one of them off-site, at all
			times</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-license-should-i-pick-for-my-datatool">What license
		should I pick for my data/tool?</h3>
	<p>
		We encourage using a free license. A representative selection of free
		licenses as well as CC licenses (more appropriate for data) is
		available directly during submission.<BR/>
		If for some reason you need a different license, <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Contact Us</a>.
